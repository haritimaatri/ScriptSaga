            <h1> ABOUT US </h1>
            <p>Welcome to our website! We are a group of students from the University of India who have created this website as part of Final Project</p>
            <p>The engrossing and informative game Language Riddles was created
            to test and improve your abilities to code spanning a variety of
            computer languages. Enter a universe in which you're going to
            gradually tackle difficult mazes and uncover programming riddles.
            Programmers travel through an online realm loaded with coding
            riddles in SCRIPT SAGA. 
            Energetic and determined, the character you
            play explores several settings that reflect coding languages like
            Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and others. Each setting is exquisitely
            designed, effectively conveying the spirit of the language it stands for.
            Each challenge of the game, which is separated into levels of difficulty,
            focuses on a distinct programming language. As you advance, you run
            into a number of problems and difficulties that call for you to write, fix,
            or improve code. The tasks come in a variety of levels of sophistication
            to suit equally novice and seasoned coders.
